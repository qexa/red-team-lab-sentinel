# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Open a **Security Advisory** on GitHub. We aim to respond within 72 hours.

## Triage
Reports are scored (CVSS-like), reproduced in an **isolated lab**, and fixed with tests. Disclosures follow coordinated timelines.

## Guardrails
This repo ships only **benign simulations** and explicit lab checks to prevent misuse.
